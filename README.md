# ECG_Simulator

This project was part of my Winter Internship 2018 at Streben Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.

### Objective
To create an bluetooth enabled ECG simulator that can mimic the existing system and can trasfer the data without the need for an human subject to be connected to it.

The system should be compact and can replace the existing ECG simulators that are bulky and a hassel to carry around as well as to connect with the software physically.

### A bit about the system:
This ECG simulator was made to mimic the ECG data input from an standard ECG machine. And so the communication protocol is being followed as per the standard. 

Other than that this project is a basic Bluetooth enabled Arduino shield project. The multiple ECG datas are stored on the Arduino and the user can choose between them from the on the board switchs. 

The whole system is conpact and can be easily use a standard mobile powerbank as a power source making it very trasportable.

#### This project was coded and executed by using the following softwares:
* CodeBlocks (C++)
* Arduino IDE (C++)
* Termite (Serial Debugging)
* Eagle 7.6.0 (PCB Designing)

### Contents of the Repository
1. A complete PCB Design with the gerber files aready created.
2. A small C++ application to run on the computer for debugging the data transfer from the Device using bluetooth or USB.
3. The final Arduino code with the preprogrammed ECG Data.
4. Few images of the schematic and final board and PCB Designs.
5. A final Internship Report for the Project.
